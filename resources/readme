How to use these images as icons:

(1) using img2py (should be available as a command-line app, or via wx.tools.img2py),
convert the png file you want to use for the icon into a python embedded image string.
You can use '-' as the output filename to output to stdout, or you can append your
new image onto cscience/GUI/icons.py.

(2) make sure the name your icon has in the index & catalog is sensible

(3) get your image back out using icons.ART_<name you gave your image> in the standard
wxPython ArtProvider usage (AKA "profit").
