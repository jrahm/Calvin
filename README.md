CScience
======

CScience is a project to aid geologists and other scientists working with ice and sediment cores in collating, manipulating, and interpreting data derived from those cores.

In development, this project depends on the following packages:

Python 2.7

numpy

scipy

matplotlib

wxPython

quantities

On a mac, wxPython does not work with the default Python 2.7 installation. A 32-bit only version of Python must be installed instead.
To run CScience, run pythonw src/cscience.py
