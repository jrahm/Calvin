CScience
======

CScience is a project to aid geologists and other scientists working with ice and sediment cores in collating, manipulating, and interpreting data derived from those cores.

In development, this project depends on the following packages:

Python 2.7

wxPython -- currently tested against version 3.0.0.0 (available at http://www.wxpython.org/download.php)

numpy

scipy

matplotlib

happybase

quantities (available at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/quantities)

Note that you will also need access to a running hbase server. Please contact Laura de Vesine or Ken Anderson for information on the current development server. You can also run a local instance of hbase for testing/development, if desired.
